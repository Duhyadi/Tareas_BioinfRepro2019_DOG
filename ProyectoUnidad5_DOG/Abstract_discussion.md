# Identification of deleterious alleles in landraces of maize

## Abstract

The source of new mutations in the plant
genome may be due to demographic demographic
historiography, gene drift, mating system
and domestication processes.
In the study, the proportion of deleterious alleles
in native maize varieties was identified using the SIFT 4G software
of Mexico, finding a very low proportion of 7%.
The above evidences the role of the purifying selection t
o eliminate deleterious alleles.

## Discussion
In general, it can be said that deleterious mutations
can be classified as strongly deleterious and weakly deleterious.
The former are rapidly purged by the purifying selection,
while the latter are maintained in a lower proportion and
are characterized by reducing the fitness
of the populations (Kono et al., 2016).

The results obtained from Arteaga et al (2016)
for heterozygosity (He), showed that the landraces
analyzed had a high genetic variation,
despite this SIFT 4 G (Vaser et al., 2015)
predicted the presence of deleterious alleles
 (see histogram on CHROM and SIFT PREDICTION),
also known as non-synonymous functional variants (Chen et al., 2018).
Expected result because it is known that domesticated
species maintain a higher proportion of deleterious
alleles compared to wild ones. Due to a reduction
in the effectiveness of natural selection,
taking advantage of gene drift (Moyers et al., 2018).
In addition, in a general way it can be affirmed that
the majority of mutations are deleterious,
while a small minority are beneficial (Mezmouk & Ross-Ibarra 2013).
This was recently documented in rice,
both in the domesticated species and in the wild (Lui et al., 2017).

It is important to note that in spite
of having found deleterious alleles,
the percentage for all the chromosomes
analyzed was 7%. The previous result
evidences the role of the purifying selection,
which beyond fulfilling an adaptive
role is more in charge of purifying
genomes of harmful mutations (Noel et al., 2019).

Regarding the percentage of
non-synonymous variants
(see histogram on CHROM and VARIANT TYPE)
a greater proportion can be observed,
in this class the variants are included: tolerated,
deleterious with low level of confidence and deleterious.
Not necessarily the non-synonymous is deleterious.
